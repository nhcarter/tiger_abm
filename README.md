NetLogo files, ODD, and original paper for agent-based model of tiger territory and population dynamics. A pdf of the Carter et al. 2015 Ecological Modelling paper is provided. The zipped file contains the models for both the circle (test) and real (Chitwan) landscapes. All models were run on NetLogo version 6.0.3. The Overview, Design, and Details (ODD) document is "ODD_TigerTerritorialDynamics.docx". The netlogo models all have file names with .nlogo. The Chitwan_base model was the model published in Carter et al. 2015 Ecological Modelling. The Chitwan_MCP includes a procedure for drawing minimum convex polygons. However, this requires that the R-extension for NetLogo (not the same as RNetLogo package in R) is installed. The Chitwan_prey_depletion model includes the parameters for running the prey depletion experiments. Likewise, the Circle_prey_depletion also includes the prey depletion parameters for the circle (test) landscape.
