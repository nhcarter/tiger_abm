NetLogo files, ODD, and published papers for agent-based model of tiger population dynamics. The pdfs of the Carter et al. 2015 Ecological Modelling and Carter et al. 2019 Ecology and Evolution papers are provided. The zipped files contain the NetLogo models (.nlogo) for all three versions of the model, including the base (published in 2015), prey depletion (published in 2019), and road impacts (in review). All models were run on NetLogo version 6.2.1. The Overview, Design, and Details (ODD) document is "ODD_TigerTerritorialDynamics.docx". The nlogo files must be in the same folder as the data_gis folder in order to run correctly.
